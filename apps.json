Please remember to reinstall the second LiveContainer to prevent data conflict.\r\nAdditionally, some apps may display a black screen and crash after 10 seconds in v3.2.0. Please refer to the \"Black Screen Fix\" section below for more details.\r \nNew Features\r\nBlack Screen Fix\r\nThe Black Screen Fix is no longer applied automatically to prevent loading \"UIKit.framework\" before the app\u2019s main executable is opened, which could cause symbol binding issues. You can enable it in Long press app -> Settings -> enable Fix Black Screen\r \nApp Group Isolation\r\nYou can now isolate app groups for different containers, allowing multiple accounts (e.g., in SideStore) to be signed in within separate containers. You can find files inside app group in container folder -> LCAppGroup\r \nYou can enable this feature by: Long press app -> Settings -> (Container name) -> enable Isolate App Group\r\nFix 279\r \nOpen URL Automatically\r\nYou can now automatically open an URL in current app without being prompted.\r\nImplement 285 \r \nIgnore Error During dlopen\r\nThis fixes errors like \"dlsym(xxxx, xxxx)\" caused by app's initializers calling dlsym with a non-existing symbol\r \nFix issues like 124\r \nBetter App Signature Check\r\nThe team ID used in app signing is now considered when determining if an app needs re-signing. This allows apps to be re-signed if they are transferred between LiveContainers installed by different Apple IDs.\r \nJIT-Less Mode Diagnose Page & LiveContainer Help\r\nA new JIT-Less Mode Diagnose Page helps new users quickly identify configuration issues. Problematic items are highlighted in red for easy troubleshooting.\r \nYou can see this page in Settings -> JIT-Less Mode Diagnose.\r\nYou can see LiveContainer help in Apps -> ? Button\r \nBug Fixes & Compatibility\r\nSeparate App-Specific Settings from Info.plist\r\nApp-Specific Settings is now saved in a different file to prevent app from crashing due to reading it.\r \nFix 277\r \nHook dlsym(RTLD_MAIN_ONLY,xxx)\r\nRedirect this call to the app's main executable instead of LiveContainer's to prevent issues.\r \nFix 124 130 140 221 225\r \nDon't Link against UIKit.framework\r\n*This solution is provided by khanhduytran0*\r\n\"UIKit.framework\" is now not linked by LiveContainer's main executable to prevent symbol binding issues. However this will prevent the black screen fix to be automatically applied.\r \nFix 277 272 200 139\r \nApp Hiding Without Device Password\r\nApp hiding now works even if the device doesn\u2019t have a password set.\r \nFix 281\r \n(Regression) Fix 2 Bugs in NSUserDefaultsHook in 3.1.0\r\nFix 276 291\r \nFix long press actions of last guest app remain\r\nFix 235\r \nFix Apps Unable to Open Their Own URL Schemes\r\nFix 44\r \nResolve Crash Loop with Blank \"Info.plist\"\r\nHandles cases where \"Info.plist\" is blank due to app corruption, which previously crashes LiveContainerSwiftUI.\r\nFix 293\r \nFix CallKit Unable to Initialize \r\nFix 258\r \nFix Crash when Patching Store\r\nThe cause of this issue is that LiveContainer cannot access App Group due to incorrect setup.",

You can switch signer in Settings and app-specific settings for one specific app.\r \nRe-Sign Only on Expiration\r\nLiveContainer now keeps track of the date of expiration of each app's code signature and only signs when its signature is expired. So re-signing happens less frequent than before.\r \nAutomatic Tweak Re-Sign\r\nLiveContainer now keeps track of the tweaks you added and re-signs it if it is changed or its code signature expires, which makes tweak development with LiveContainer more convenient.\r \nImplement 175.\r \nMultiple Container Support\r\nYou can now create up to 3 containers for each app, so you can log in multiple accounts in different containers(data folders).\r \nKeychains are now semi-separated between app containers. Note that keychains will be removed if you delete a container in LiveContainer.\r \nkeychains created in older version will remain untouched so you can continue using your apps like before. To use this feature, clean up your keychain in LiveContainer settings.\r \nThis feature, along with the following fix of NSUserDefault leak impelements 218 176.\r \nLanguage Selection for Each App\r\nYou can now choose an language for an app in app-specific settings.\r \nImplement 171\r \nApp Preferences\r\nYou can now modify app preferences in LiveContainer like in iOS Settings. To change app preferences, go to app-specific settings -> (container name) -> Container Preferences\r \nImplement 252\r \nForce Orientation Lock\r\nThis option can be used to solve some game having stretched/mal-functioning UI when launched in portrait mode\r \nImplement 251\r \nJITLess Support for Multiple SideStores\r\nIf you use Multiple SideStores with SparseRestore, you can now export the tweaked SideStore IPA and install it manually to enable JITLess mode.\r \nImplement 219\r \nBug Fixes\r\n\u2022 NSUserDefault Leak & Random Signing out: NSUserDefault(app preferences) are now *almost* separated and properly placed in app's data folder. Solve 149 163 215\r\n\u2022 Game Controller Support: You can now use game controllers in LiveContainer\r\n\u2022 Hook \"-[VSSubscriptionRegistrationCenter setCurrentSubscription:]\": Solve 227\r\n\u2022 New file picker & local notification fix\r\n\u2022 App receiving LiveContainer's launch URL after launch: Solve 243\r\n",

App and their data, Keychains and most preferences can be shared between these two. If user open an app via URL Scheme or from My Apps screen, the LiveContainer that last ran that app will be switched to.\r \nBetter Open in App Support (153)\r\nIt turns out that some apps don't rely on URL Schemes and use Universal Links instead. In this update, the web page's \"apple-app-site-association\" will be checked and LiveContainer will launch app based on it.\r \nLocalization (153)\r\nLocalization is now supported. You can add a language in LiveContainerSwiftUI project and add your translation in \"Localizable.xcstrings\", then submit your translation as PR.

Apparently using the private Preference framework causing changes to be saved to the wrong preference file.\r\n\u2022 Some apps may get stuck on a black screen caused by an unknown deadlock. This is worked around by pre-initializing \"UIScreen\".\r\n\u2022 Some apps may fail to create temporary files.
